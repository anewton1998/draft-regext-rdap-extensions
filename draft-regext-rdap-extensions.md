.# Abstract

This document describes and clarifies the usage of extensions in RDAP.

{mainmatter}

# Background

The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) defines a uniform protocol
to access data from Internet operations registries, specifically
Domain Name Registries (DNRs), Regional Internet Registries
(RIRs), and other registries serving Internet Number Resources (INRs).
RDAP queries are defined in [@!RFC9082] and RDAP responses are defined
in [@!RFC9083].
A> issue #38

RDAP contains a means to define extensions for queries not found in
[@!RFC9082] and responses not found in [@!RFC9083]. RDAP extensions
are also described in [@!RFC7480].  This document describes the
requirements for RDAP extension definition and use, clarifying
ambiguities and defining additional semantics and options that were
previously implicit.

## Summary of Updates

This document updates [@!RFC7480], [@!RFC9082], and [@!RFC9083] to be consistent
with RDAP extensions that have been defined by the IETF and for which there are no known
interoperability issues. The updates in this document should require no changes
to either client or server implementations.

This document describes the following methods for extending RDAP by registered extensions:

1. JSON Names - The most common extension point for RDAP is the definition of new JSON Names. Guidance is provided here in regards in [@!RFC7480] and [@!RFC9083].
1. Query Paths - New lookups and searches are defined using URL paths. This document clarifies the practice as described in [@!RFC9082].
1. Query Parameters - Many queries use URL query parameters to scope and/or enhance RDAP results. This document clarifies the practice as described in [@!RFC9082].
1. HTTP Headers - Some extensions may use HTTP headers not explicitly enumerated by [@!RFC7480].
1. Object Classes - Extensions may define new types of objects to be queried. This document clarifies this method as described in [@!RFC9082] and [@!RFC9083].

A> issue #62

This document does not describe the usage of URL matrix parameters as they are NOT RECOMMENDED for use with RDAP
as they are not widely implemented in broader web architecture and have the potential to interfere with query parameters and query paths.
A> issue #60

Additionally, this document updates the IANA registry practices for RDAP. See (#iana_considerations).
A> issue #62

## Document Terms

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
"MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in [@!BCP14] when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Identifiers {#identifiers}

## Purpose {#purpose}

[@!RFC7480, section 6] describes the identifier used to signify RDAP
extensions and the IANA registry into which RDAP extensions are to be
registered.

When in use in RDAP, extension identifiers are prepended to URL path
segments, URL query parameters, and JSON object member names (herein
further referred to as "JSON names").  They are also included in the
"rdapConformance" member of each response that relies on the
extension, so that clients can determine the extensions being used by
the server for that response.  The "/help" response returns an
"rdapConformance" member containing the identifiers for all extensions
used by the server.

The main purpose of the extension identifier is to act as a namespace,
preventing collisions between elements from different extensions.
Additionally, implementers and operators can use the extension
identifiers to find extension definitions via an IANA registry.

### Profile and Marker Extensions {#profiles_and_markers}

While the RDAP extension mechanism was created to extend RDAP queries
and/or responses, extensions can also be used to signal server policy
(for example, specifying the conditions of use for existing response
structures). Extensions that are primarily about signaling server
policy are often called "profiles".

Profile extensions often do the following:

* Mark some specific extensions (and versions thereof) as required.
* Mark some specific optional queries, object classes, or JSON structures as required.
* Limit or restrict the values of specific JSON structures.
A> issue #39

Some extensions exist to denote the usage of values placed into an
IANA registry, such as the IANA RDAP registries, or the usage of
extensions for specifications used in RDAP responses, such as extended
vCard/jCard properties.  Such extensions exist to "mark" these usages
and are often called "marker" extensions.

For example, an extension may be used to signal desired processing of
a "rel" attribute in a "links" array, where the "rel" value is
registered in the Link Relations Registry
(<https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml>):

    {
      "rdapConformance": [
        "rdap_level_0",
        "lunarNIC"
      ],
      "objectClassName": "domain",
      "ldhName": "example.com",
      "links": [
        {
          "value": "https://example.com/domain/example.com",
          "href": "https://example.com/sideways_href",
          "rel": "sideways",
          "type": "application/rdap+json"
        }
      ]
    }

When defining the usage of link relations, extensions should specify
the media types expected to be used with those link relations.

Regardless of the category of the extension, its usage may also
leverage the appearance of its identifier in the "rdapConformance"
array.
A> issue #59

As described above, these characteristics are not exclusive to profile
extensions and may be found in extensions defining new queries, JSON, etc...
A> issue #39

### Multiple Identifiers in Single Extension

Extension specifications have customarily defined only one extension
identifier.  However, there is no explicit limit on the number of
extension identifiers that may be defined in a single extension
specification.  The main reason for defining multiple identifiers is
to reserve multiple namespaces in URLs or responses: see e.g.
[@?I-D.ietf-regext-rdap-rir-search].

## Syntax {#syntax}

In brief, RDAP extension identifiers start with an alphabetic
character and may contain alphanumeric characters and "_" (underscore)
characters. This formulation was explicitly chosen to allow
compatibility with variable names in programming languages and
transliteration with XML.

RDAP extension identifiers have no explicit structure, and are opaque
insofar as no inner-meaning can be "seen" in them.

RDAP extensions MUST NOT define an extension identifier that when
prepended to an underscore character may collide with an existing
extension identifier.  For example, if there were a pre-existing
identifier of "foo_bar", another extension could not define the
identifier "foo". Likewise, if there were a pre-existing identifier of
"foo_bar", another extension could not define the identifier
"foo_bar_buzz".  However, an extension could define "foo" if there
were a pre-existing definition of "foobar", and vice versa.

For this reason, usage of an underscore character in RDAP extension
identifiers is NOT RECOMMENDED. Implementers should be aware that many
existing extension identifiers do contain underscore characters.

[@!RFC7480] does not explicitly state that extension identifiers are
case-sensitive.  This document clarifies the formulation in [@!RFC7480]
to explicitly note that extension identifiers are case-sensitive, and
extension identifiers MUST NOT be registered where a new identifier is
a mixed-case version of an existing identifier (see (#rdap_extensions_registry)). For example, if
"lunarNIC" is already registered as an identifier, a new registration
with "lunarNic" (note the lowercase if "ic" in "Nic") would not be
allowed.
A> issue #33

## Usage in Requests {#usage_in_requests}

### Usage in Paths {#usage_in_paths}

[@!RFC9082, section 5] describes the use of extension identifiers in
formulating URLs to query RDAP servers. The extension identifiers are
to be prepended to the path segments they use. For example, if an
extension uses the identifier "foobar", then the path segments used in
that extension are prepended with "foobar_".  If the "foobar"
extension defines paths "fizz" and "fazz", the URLs for this extension
would be like so:

    https://base.example/foobar_fizz
    https://base.example/foobar_fazz

While [@!RFC9082] describes the extension identifier as a prepended
string to a path segment, it does not describe the usage of the
extension identifier as a path segment which may have child path
segments. This document updates [@!RFC9082] to allow the usage of
extension identifiers as path segments which may have child path
segments. For example, if the "foobar" extension defines the child
paths "fizz" and "fazz", the URLs for this extension would be like so:

    https://base.example/foobar/fizz
    https://base.example/foobar/fazz

Extensions defining new URL paths MUST explicitly define the expected
responses for each new URL path. New URL paths may return existing
object classes or search results as defined in [@!RFC9083], object
classes or search results defined by the extension (see
(#object_classes_in_extensions) and (#search_results_in_extensions)
below), or object classes or search results from other extensions.

From a protocol perspective, the difference between prepending the extension ID to
the last path segment (e.g. https://base.example/foobar_fizz) and using an
extension ID as a path segment (e.g. https://base.example/foobar/fizz) is just
the difference of the underscore and backslash characters. Extension authors
may use either approach but should rely on implementation experience.
A> issue #34

Appending a path segment to another path segment is NOT RECOMMENDED as
this increases the likelihood of collisions between the queries defined
by extension identifiers.
A> issue #36

### Usage in Query Parameters {#usage_in_query_parameters}

Although [@!RFC9082] describes the use of URL query strings, it does
not define their use with extensions. [@!RFC7480] instructs servers to
ignore unknown query parameters. Therefore, the use of query
parameters, whether prefixed with an extension identifier or not, is
not supported by [@!RFC9082] and [@!RFC7480].

Despite this, there are several extensions that do specify query
parameters.  This document updates [@!RFC9082] with regard to the use
of RDAP extension identifiers in URL query parameters.

When an RDAP extension defines query parameters to be used with a URL
path that is not defined by that RDAP extension, those query parameter
names SHOULD be constructed in the same manner as URL path segments
(that is, extension identifier + '_' + parameter name).  (See section
(#identifier_omission) regarding when an extension identifier may be
omitted.)

When an RDAP extension defines query parameters to be used with a URL
path defined by that RDAP extension, prefixing of query parameters is
not required.  In this situation, the URL path operates as a namespace
for the query parameters, so there is no risk of collision with
parameters defined elsewhere.

See (#redirects_author) and (#referrals) for other guidance on the use of
query parameters, and see (#security_considerations) and
(#privacy_considerations) regarding constraints on the usage of query
parameters.

## Usage in Responses {#usage_in_responses}

### Basic Requirements {#usage_in_responses}

[@!RFC9083, section 2] describes the use of extension identifiers in
the JSON returned by RDAP servers. Just as in URLs, the extension
identifier is prepended to JSON names to create a namespace so that
the JSON name from one extension will not collide with the JSON name
from another extension. Just as with unknown query parameters in URLs,
clients are to ignore unknown JSON names.

The example given in [@!RFC9083] is as follows:

    {
      "handle": "ABC123",
      "lunarNIC_beforeOneSmallStep": "TRUE THAT!",
      "remarks":
      [
        {
          "description":
          [
            "She sells sea shells down by the sea shore.",
            "Originally written by Terry Sullivan."
          ]
        }
      ],
      "lunarNIC_harshMistressNotes":
      [
        "In space,",
        "nobody can hear you scream."
      ]
    }

In this example, the extension identified by "lunarNIC" is prepended
to the member names of both a JSON string and a JSON array.

As [@!RFC9083, section 4.1] requires the use of the "rdapConformance"
data structure, and the "objectClassName" string is required of all
object class instances, the complete example from above would be:

    {
      "rdapConformance": [
        "rdap_level_0",
        "lunarNIC"
      ],
      "objectClassName": "domain",
      "handle": "ABC123",
      "ldhName": "example.com",
      "lunarNIC_beforeOneSmallStep": "TRUE THAT!",
      "remarks":
      [
        {
          "description":
          [
            "She sells sea shells down by the sea shore.",
            "Originally written by Terry Sullivan."
          ]
        }
      ],
      "lunarNIC_harshMistressNotes":
      [
        "In space,",
        "nobody can hear you scream."
      ]
    }

### Child JSON Values {#child_json_values}

Prefixing of the extension identifier is not required for children of
a prefixed JSON object defined by an RDAP extension.

The following example shows this use with a JSON object:

    {
      "rdapConformance": [
        "rdap_level_0",
        "lunarNIC"
      ],
      "objectClassName": "domain",
      "ldhName": "example.com",
      "remarks":
      [
        {
          "description":
          [
            "She sells sea shells down by the sea shore.",
            "Originally written by Terry Sullivan."
          ]
        }
      ],
      "lunarNIC_author":
      {
        "firstInitial": "R",
        "lastName": "Heinlein"
      }
    }

Here the JSON name "lunarNIC_author" will separate the JSON from other
extensions that may have an "author" structure. But the JSON contained
within "lunarNIC_author" need not be prepended, as collision is
avoided by the use of "lunarNIC_author".

### Object Classes in Extensions {#object_classes_in_extensions}

As described in [@!RFC9082] and (#usage_in_requests), an extension may
define new paths in URLs.  If the extension describes the behavior of
an RDAP query using that path to return an instance of a new class of
RDAP object, the JSON names are not required to be prepended with the
extension identifier as described in (#child_json_values). However,
the extension MUST define the value for the "objectClassName" string
which is used by clients to evaluate the type of the response.  To
avoid collisions with object classes defined in other extensions, the
value for the "objectClassName" MUST be prepended with the extension
identifier, in the same way as for URL paths, query parameters, and
JSON names:

    {
      "rdapConformance": [
        "rdap_level_0",
        "lunarNIC"
      ],
      "objectClassName": "lunarNIC_author",
      "author":
      {
        "firstInitial": "R",
        "lastName": "Heinlein"
      }
    }

It is RECOMMENDED that object class names use the "camel case" style
described in (#camel_casing).
Though "objectClassName" is a string and [@!RFC9083] does
define one object class name with a space separator (i.e. "ip
network"), usage of the space character or any other character that
requires URL-encoding is NOT RECOMMENDED.  When object class names are
also used in URLs, extensions MUST specify that the names are to be
URL-encoded as defined in [@!RFC3986] if the object class names
contain any characters requiring URL-encoding.
A> issue #40

### Search Results in Extensions {#search_results_in_extensions}

As described in [@!RFC9082] and (#usage_in_requests), an extension may
define new paths in URLs.  If the extension describes the behavior of
an RDAP query using the path to return a new RDAP search result, the
JSON name of the search result MUST be prepended with the extension
identifier (to avoid collision with search results defined in other
extensions).  If the search result contains object class instances
defined by the extension, each instance MUST have an "objectClassName"
string as defined in (#object_classes_in_extensions).  For example:

    {
      "rdapConformance": [
        "rdap_level_0",
        "lunarNIC"
      ],
      "lunarNIC_authorSearchResult": [
        {
          "objectClassName": "lunarNIC_author",
          "author":
          {
            "firstInitial": "R",
            "lastName": "Heinlein"
          }
        },
        {
          "objectClassName": "lunarNIC_author",
          "author":
          {
            "firstInitial": "J",
            "lastName": "Pournelle"
          }
        },
      ]
    }

### Bare Extension Identifiers {#bare_extension}

Some RDAP extensions define only one JSON value and do not prefix it
with their RDAP extension identifier, instead using the extension
identifier as the JSON name for that JSON value. That is, the
extension identifier is used "bare" and not appended with an
underscore character and subsequent names.

Consider the example in (#child_json_values). Using the bare extension
identifier pattern, that example could be written as:

    {
      "rdapConformance": [
        "rdap_level_0",
        "lunarNIC"
      ],
      "objectClassName": "domain",
      "ldhName": "example.com",
      "remarks":
      [
        {
          "description":
          [
            "She sells sea shells down by the sea shore.",
            "Originally written by Terry Sullivan."
          ]
        }
      ],
      "lunarNIC":
      {
        "firstInitial": "R",
        "lastName": "Heinlein"
      }
    }

Along similar lines, an extension may define a single new object
class, and use the extension's identifier as the object class name.

Usage of a bare extension identifier conflicts with the guidance in
[@!RFC9083, section 2.1].  This document clarifies [@!RFC9083] to explicitly allow
this pattern but advises extension authors to use this pattern when only one
query path, JSON names, or object class is being defined by the extension.
A> issue #37

### rdapConformance Population

[@!RFC9083, section 4.1] offers the following guidance on including
extension identifiers in the "rdapConformance" member of an RDAP
response:

    A response to a "help" request will include identifiers for all of
    the specifications supported by the server. A response to any
    other request will include only identifiers for the specifications
    used in the construction of the response.

A strict interpretation of this wording where "construction of the
response" refers to the JSON structure only would rule out the use of
(#profiles_and_markers) extension identifiers, which are in common use
in RDAP.  This document updates the guidance. For responses to queries
other than "/help", a response MUST include in the "rdapConformance"
array only those extension identifiers necessary for a client to
deserialize the JSON and understand the semantic meaning of the
content within the JSON, and each extension identifier MUST be free
from conflict with the other identifiers with respect to their syntax
and semantics.

Note that this document does not update the guidance from [@!RFC9083, section 4.1]
regarding "/help" responses and the "rdapConformance" array.

When a server implementation supports multiple extensions, it is
RECOMMENDED that the server also support and return versioning
information such as that defined by
[@?I-D.gould-regext-rdap-versioning].

### Camel Casing {#camel_casing}

The styling convention used in [@!RFC9083] for JSON names is often
called "camel casing", in reference to the hump of a camel. In this
style, the first letter of every word, except the first word,
composing a name is capitalized.  This convention was adopted to
visually separate the namespace from the name, with an underscore
between them.  Extension authors SHOULD use camel casing for JSON
names defined in extensions.

## Identifier Omission {#identifier_omission}

Though all RDAP extensions are to be registered in the IANA RDAP
Extensions Registry, there is an implicit two-class system of
extensions that comes from the ownership of the RDAP specifications by
the IETF: extensions created by the IETF and extensions not created by
the IETF.

In the perspective of how extension identifiers are used as namespace
separators, extensions created by the IETF are not required to use the
extension identifier as a prefix in requests and responses, as the
IETF can coordinate its own activities to avoid name collisions. In
practice, most extensions owned by the IETF do use extension
identifiers as prefixes in their requests and responses.

RDAP extensions not defined by the IETF MUST use the extension
identifier as a prefix in accordance with this document, [@!RFC7480],
[@!RFC9082], and [@!RFC9083].  RDAP extensions defined by the IETF
SHOULD use the extension identifier as a prefix or as a bare extension
identifier (see (#bare_extension)).  IETF-defined RDAP extensions that
do not follow this guidance MUST describe why it is not being
followed.

# Extension Implementer Considerations {#extension_implementer_considerations}

## Redirects {#redirects_implementer}

[@!RFC7480] describes the use of redirects in RDAP. Redirects are prominent
in the discovery of authoritative RIR servers, as the process outlined in
[@!RFC9224], which uses IANA allocations, does not account for transfers of
resources between RIRs. [@!RFC7480, section 4.3] instructs servers to ignore
unknown query parameters. As it relates to issuing URLs for redirects, servers
MUST NOT blindly copy query parameters from a request to a redirect URL as
query parameters may contain sensitive information, such as security credentials,
not relevant to the target server of the URL. Following the advice in [@!RFC7480],
servers SHOULD only place query parameters in redirect URLs when it is known
by the origin server (the server issuing the redirect) that the target server
(the server referenced by the redirect) can process the query parameter and the
contents of the query parameter are appropriate to be received by the target.

# Extension Author Considerations {#extension_author_considerations}

## Redirects {#redirects_author}

As it is unlikely that every server in a cross-authority, redirect
scenario will be upgraded to process every new extension, extensions
should not rely on query parameters alone to convey information about
a resource, as query parameters are not guaranteed to survive a
redirect.

This does not mean extensions are prohibited from using query
parameters, but rather that the use of query parameters must be
applied for the scenarios appropriate for the use of the extension.
Therefore, extensions SHOULD NOT rely on query parameters when the
extension is to be used in scenarios requiring clients to find
authoritative servers, or other scenarios using redirects among
servers of differing authorities.

Extensions MAY use query parameters in scenarios where the client has
a priori knowledge of the authoritative server to which queries are to
be sent, and will be sending queries to that server directly.
Searches ([@!RFC9083, section 8]) are an example scenario where a
client will be operating in this way.

In general, extension authors should be mindful of situations
requiring clients to directly handle redirects at the RDAP layer. Some
clients may not be utilizing HTTP libraries that provide such an
option, and many HTTP client libraries that do provide the option do
not provide it as a default behavior. Additionally, requiring clients
to handle redirects at the RDAP layer adds complexity to the client in
that additional logic must be implemented to handle redirect loops,
parameter deconfliction, and URL encoding. The guidance given in
[@!RFC7480, section 5.2] exists to simplify clients, especially those
constructed with shell scripts and HTTP command-line utilities.

## Referrals {#referrals}

It is common in the RDAP ecosystem to link from one RDAP resource to
another, such as can be found in domain registrations in gTLD DNRs.
These are typically conveyed in the link structure defined in
[@!RFC9083, section 4.2] and use the "application/rdap+json" media
type.  For example:

    {
      "value": "https://regy.example/domain/foo.example",
      "rel": "related",
      "href": "https://regr.example/domain/foo.example",
      "type": "application/rdap+json"
    }

Extensions MUST explicitly define any required behavioral changes to
the processing of referrals.  If an extension does not make any
provision in this respect, clients MUST assume the information
provided by referrals requires no additional processing or
modification to use in the dereferencing of the referral.

## Extension Versioning {#versioning}

As stated in (#purpose), RDAP extension identifiers and RDAP
conformance strings are opaque, and
they possess no explicit version despite the fact that some extension
identifiers include trailing numbers. That is, RDAP extensions without
an explicitly-defined versioning scheme are opaquely versioned.
A> issue #38

For example, "fizzbuzz_1" may be the successor to "fizzbuzz_0", but it
may also be an extension for a completely separate purpose. Only
consultation of the definition of "fizzbuzz_1" will determine its
relationship with "fizzbuzz_0". Additionally, "fizzbuzz_99" may be the
predecessor of "fizzbuzz_0".

If a future RFC defines a versioning scheme, an RDAP extension
definition MUST explicitly denote its compliance with that scheme.

### Backwards-Compatible Changes {#backwards_compatible_changes}

If an RDAP extension author wants to publish a new version of an
extension that is backwards-compatible with the previous version, then
one option is for the new version of the extension to define a new
identifier, as well as requiring that both the previous identifier
and the new identifier be included in the "rdapConformance" array of
responses.  That way, clients relying on the previous version of the
extension will continue to function as intended, while clients wanting
to make use of the newer version of the extension can check for the new
identifier in the response.

This approach can be used for an arbitrary number of new
backwards-compatible versions of a given extension.  For an extension
with a large number of backwards-compatible successor versions, this
may lead to a large number of identifiers being included in responses.
An extension author may consider excluding older identifiers from the
set required by new successor versions, based on data about client
use/support or similar.

### Backwards-Incompatible Changes {#backwards_incompatible_changes}

With the current extension model, an extension with a
backwards-incompatible change is indistinguishable from a new,
unrelated extension.  Implementers of such changes should consider the
following:

 - whether the new version of the extension can be provided alongside
   the old version of the extension, so that a service can simply
   support both during a transition period;
 - whether some sort of client signaling should be supported, so that
   clients can opt for the old or new version of the extension in
   responses that they receive (see
   [@?I-D.newton-regext-rdap-x-media-type] for an example of how this
   might work); and
 - whether the extension itself should define how versioning is
   handled within the extension documentation.

## Extension Specification Content

The primary purpose of an RDAP extension specification is to aid in
the implementation of RDAP clients. Extension authors should consider
the following content guidelines:

1. Examples of RDAP JSON should be generously given, especially in
areas of the specification which may be complex or difficult to describe
with prose.
2. Normative references, i.e. references to materials that are
required for the interoperability of the extension, should be stable
and non-changing.
3. Extension specifications should strongly consider making the use
of HTTPS with RDAP mandatory if appropriate.

## Extension Definitions

Extensions must be documented in an RFC or in some other permanent and
readily available reference, in sufficient detail that
interoperability between independent implementations is possible.

Though RDAP gives each extension its own namespace, the definition of
an extension may reuse definitions found in the base RDAP
specification or in any other registered extension.

[@!RFC9083] notes that the extension identifiers provide a "hint" to
the client as to how to interpret the response. This wording does not
intentionally restrict the extension to defining only JSON values
within the extension's namespace.  Therefore, an extension may define
the use of its own JSON values together with the use of JSON values
from other extensions or RDAP specifications. As with the
[@icann-profile]
and [@nro-profile] extensions, the extension may simply signal
policy applied to previously-defined RDAP structures.

# Existing Extension Registrations {#existing_extension_registrations}

The following extensions have been registered with IANA, but do not
comply with the requirements set out in the base specifications, as
clarified by this document:

 - Extension identifier: fred
    - RDAP conformance value: fred\_version\_0
    - Field/path prefix: fred

 - Extension identifier: artRecord
    - RDAP conformance value: artRecord\_level\_0
    - Field/path prefix: artRecord

 - Extension identifier: platformNS
    - RDAP conformance value: platformNS\_level\_0
    - Field/path prefix: platformNS

 - Extension identifier: regType
    - RDAP conformance value: regType\_level\_0
    - Field/path prefix: regType

Client authors should be aware that responses that make use of these
extensions may require special handling on the part of the client.
Also, while these extensions will be retained in the registry, future
extensions that are similarly non-compliant will not be registered.

To avoid any confusion with the operation of the existing entries, an
extension registration that attempts to use one of the RDAP
conformance values given in this section as an extension identifier
(and so as an RDAP conformance value also) will be rejected.

# IANA Considerations

## RDAP Extensions Registry {#rdap_extensions_registry}

[@!RFC7480] defines the RDAP Extensions Registry (<https://www.iana.org/assignments/rdap-extensions/rdap-extensions.xhtml>).
This document does not change the RDAP Extensions Registry nor its purpose. However, this
document does update the procedures to be used by its expert reviewers.

The RDAP Extensions Registry should have as a minimum three expert reviewers
and ideally four or five. An expert reviewer assigned to the review of an RDAP
extension registration must have another expert reviewer double-check any
submitted registration.

Expert reviewers are to use the following criteria for extensions
defined in this document, [@!RFC7480], [@!RFC9082], and [@!RFC9083].
The following is a summary checklist:

1. Does the extension define an extension identifier following the naming
conventions described in (#purpose) and (#camel_casing)? For
any recommendations regarding naming conventions (guidance given using
RECOMMENDED, SHOULD, etc.), does the extension describe the need for
departing from the established convention?
2. If the extension defines new queries, does it clearly describe the
expected results of each new query?
3. Does the extension follow the JSON naming requirements as described in (#usage_in_responses)?
4. If the extension is a newer version of an older extension, does
the extension specification clearly describe if it is backwards-compatible
(see (#backwards_compatible_changes)) or backwards-incompatible
(see (#backwards_incompatible_changes))?
5. If the extension registers new values in an IANA registry used by RDAP,
does it describe how a client is to use those values?
6. If the extension is a new registration, is it a case-variant of an
existing registration (see (#syntax)).
A> issue #33

As noted in (#syntax), any new registration that is a case variant of
an existing registration MUST be rejected.

RDAP clients SHOULD match values in this registry using
case-insensitive matching.

Extension authors are encouraged but not required to seek an informal review
of their extension by sending a request for review to regext@ietf.org.

## RDAP JSON Values Registry {#rdap_json_values_registry}

[@!RFC9083, section 10.2] defines the [RDAP JSON Values Registry in IANA]
(https://www.iana.org/assignments/rdap-json-values/rdap-json-values.xhtml).
This registry contains values to be used in the JSON values of RDAP responses.
Registrations into this registry may occur in IETF-defined RDAP extensions
or via requests to the IANA. Authors of RDAP extensions not defined by the
IETF MAY register values in this registry via requests to the IANA.

This document does not change the RDAP JSON Values Registry nor its purpose.
However, this document does update the procedures for registrations and the
processes to be used by its expert reviewers.

In addition to the registration of values, RDAP extensions defined by
the IETF and other IETF specifications MAY define additional value
types (the "type" field).  These specifications MUST describe the
specific JSON field to be used for each new value type.

[@!RFC9083, section 10.2] defines the criteria for the values. Of these, criteria two
states:

> Values must be strings. They should be multiple words separated by single
> space characters. Every character should be lowercased. If possible, every
> word should be given in English and each character should be US-ASCII.

All registrations SHOULD meet these requirements. However, there may be scenarios
in which it is more appropriate for the values to follow other
requirements, such as for values also used in other specifications or documents. In all cases,
it should be understood that additional registrations of RDAP JSON values occurring
after the specification of the value's type in the registry may not be
recognized by clients, and therefore either ignored or passed on to users
without processing.

Designated experts MUST reject any registration that is a duplicate of an
existing registration, and all registrations are to be considered case-insensitive.
That is, any new registration that is a case variant of an existing registration
should be rejected.

RDAP clients SHOULD match values in this registry using case-insensitive matching.

Definitions of new types (see above) MAY additionally constrain the format of
values for those new types beyond the specification of this document and [@!RFC9083].
Designated experts MUST evaluate registrations with those criteria.

The RDAP JSON Values Registry should have as a minimum three expert reviewers
and ideally four or five. An expert reviewer assigned to the review of an RDAP
JSON values registration must have another expert reviewer double-check any
submitted registration.

Expert reviewers are to use the criteria defined in [@!RFC9083, section 10.2].

# Security Considerations {#security_considerations}

(#usage_in_query_parameters) describes the usage of query parameters and (#redirects_author) describes
the restrictions extensions must follow to use them.
[@!RFC7480, section 4.3] instructs servers to ignore
unknown query parameters. As it relates to issuing URLs for redirects, servers
MUST NOT blindly copy query parameters from a request to a redirect URL as
query parameters may contain sensitive information, such as security credentials
or tracking information, not relevant to the target server of the URL. Following the advice in [@!RFC7480],
servers SHOULD only place query parameters in redirect URLs when it is known
by the origin server (the server issuing the redirect) that the target server
(the server referenced by the redirect) can process the query parameter and the
contents of the query parameter are appropriate to be received by the target.

# Privacy Considerations {#privacy_considerations}

(#usage_in_query_parameters) describes the usage of query parameters
and (#redirects_author) describes the restrictions extensions must follow to
use them. As query parameters have been known to be used to subvert
the privacy preferences of users in HTTP-based protocols, server MUST
NOT blindly copy query parameters from a request to a redirect URL as
described in (#security_considerations) and extensions MUST follow the
constraints of query parameter usage as defined in (#redirects_author).
